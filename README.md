# Lung-Cancer-Insights

Project: Lung Cancer Data Analytics – End-to-End Health Intelligence

Tools Used:
-SQL (PostgreSQL) for data extraction, survival rate calculations, treatment duration analysis
-Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib) for exploratory data analysis and visualizations
-Excel for initial preprocessing and cleaning
-Power BI for interactive dashboards and stakeholder reporting

Project Summary:
This project aimed to extract actionable insights from a comprehensive fictional dataset of 890,000 lung cancer patients, using real-world analytical tools.

Key outcomes included:
-Only 22% of patients survived post-treatment, highlighting the severity of the disease.
-Highest patient concentration was in the 51–60 age group, with nearly 12,600+ patients.
-Gender distribution is nearly equal: 49.98% male, 50.02% female.
-Smoking patterns were almost evenly distributed: 25% each across passive, former, never, and current smokers.
-Among treatment types, Surgery showed slightly higher survival effectiveness with 49,452 survivors, followed by Combined Therapy (49,002).
-Comorbidities like hypertension (25%) and asthma were prevalent among patients, possibly impacting survival rates.
-Diagnosis remained stable from 2015 to 2023, averaging 89,000 patients/year, with peaks in January, July, and December.

Objective:
The objective of this project was to perform a comprehensive analysis of lung cancer patient data using Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI to identify survival trends, treatment effectiveness, and risk factors such as age, gender, smoking habits, and comorbidities. The goal was to derive actionable insights that can assist healthcare professionals in optimizing diagnosis, treatment strategies, and patient care outcomes.

What I Delivered:
-SQL query outputs for survival segmentation and treatment outcomes
-Python-based data wrangling and visualization
-Cleaned and structured Excel data
-Power BI Dashboards including:
1.Overview Analysis
2.Demographic Analysis
3.Treatment & Comorbidities
4.Timeline Trends
